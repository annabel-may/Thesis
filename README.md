Welcome to the GitHub Repository for the thesis 'Exploring the transcriptomic landscape of the Drosophila Melanogaster embryonic salivary gland.' by Annabel May

This repository contains all the code used to generate figures and analysis found in the thesis. Files are titled by their figure or section number, once code is completed for a figure it is marked by a "!". All coding was carried out in RStudio.

If you would like the origninal sequencing files, please contact me. 

Thank you,
Annabel May.
